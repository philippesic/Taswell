## Taswell is an experimental TypeScript-based programming language by Philip Pesic.

##### Taswell's intended purpose was to be a webapp language compiled to JavaScript. Built off of TypeScript using Antlr, it is a free-time project started to test my skills as a developer and my ability to learn new technologies.

##### The development of Taswell is currently being put on hold as I attend to other things, however it is still a work-in-progress. Note that the current repo is a very early version of the language, and is not currently functional due to issues with overriding TypeScript default grammar.

##### If you clone the repository, you will find an example main.tas file that highlights the intended functionality of the language's current features. It is not currently functional, but will be once development resumes.

##### If you wish to contribute, please submit a pull request. If you have any questions about the project or development process, you can contact me via email.
