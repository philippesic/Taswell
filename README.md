## Taswell is an experimental TypeScript-based programming language by Philip Pesic.

##### Taswell's intended purpose was to be a webapp language compiled to JavaScript. Built off of TypeScript using Antlr, Taswell is a free-time project started just to test my skills as a developer and my ability to learn new technologies.

##### However, after many hours of research, testing, building, and troubleshooting, I was unsuccessful. Regardless, the development of Taswell was a tremendous learning opportunity; although I have not built a functioning language and compiler, most of the infrustructure is here, and I have learned lots about language grammar, Antlr, and compilers.

##### Someday, when my programming skills and general knowledge have improved, I may return to this project with fresh motivation, but for now, the time investment with my current skill level would prove to be unfeasible.

##### If you wish to clone this repository for personal purposes or to look through the source, you may, but although I will not officially liscence this, I ask that you do not distribute your own versions of Taswell or release the language as your own.
